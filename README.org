* Assumptions:
- many intrinsics like ~__is_union~ available
* TODO
http://blog.nuggetwheat.org/index.php/2015/09/01/why-pointer_traits-was-introduced-in-c11/
- implement list with pointer traits
- use gcc/clang's modules.
- simplify empty base classes once no_unique_address is available on clang.(it
  is available on gcc now though)
- use [[http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2018/p0892r2.html][explicit(bool)]] for pair/tuple once it is available.(gcc 9 has this
  feature, but I'm too lazy to compile it myself, clang doesn't work on it yet).
