* Assumptions:
- many intrinsics like ~__is_union~ available
* TODO
http://blog.nuggetwheat.org/index.php/2015/09/01/why-pointer_traits-was-introduced-in-c11/
- implement list with pointer traits
- import gsl's Expects(preconditions) and Ensures(postconditions)
- use gcc/clang's modules.
- simplify empty base classes once no_unique_address is available on clang.(it
  is available on gcc now though)
- use [[http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2018/p0892r2.html][explicit(bool)]] for pair/tuple once it is available.(gcc 9 has this
  feature, but I'm too lazy to compile it myself, clang doesn't work on it yet).
**  papers to read
- [[http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3465.pdf][Adding heterogeneous comparison lookup toassociative containers]]
* Conversion
- faiz::index for all container indexes/subscripts/sizes, IOW, Don't use unsigned for subscripts, prefer gsl::index
- Geneally, I prefer metafunction over free constexpr function, because the
  formmer can do more.
