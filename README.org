* Different behavior from c++ standard library
** unique_ptr
*** compare functions for array
don't support arrray-compare free functions. IOW, Faiz::unique_ptr doesn't
  support https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/testsuite/20_util/unique_ptr/specialized_algorithms/comparisons_array.cc
Why? you know, compare array with operator ~</>/<=/>=~...... make no sense at
  all. But why does the standard library support? Because they are ~free
  functions~, rather than friend/member function, and array version of
  `class_unique_ptr<T[], Deleter>` is specializeed template, so it can use
  primary template's free function. How do I disable them? change free functions
  into friend function with ~class totally_ordered~, but ~operator <~ and
  ~operator ==~ are still free functions now.
* TODO
http://blog.nuggetwheat.org/index.php/2015/09/01/why-pointer_traits-was-introduced-in-c11/
- implement list with pointer traits
- use gsl's Expects(preconditions) and Ensures(postconditions)
- use gcc/clang's modules.
- simplify empty base classes once no_unique_address is available on clang.(it
  is available on gcc now though)
- use [[http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2018/p0892r2.html][explicit(bool)]] for pair/tuple once it is available.(gcc 9 has this
  feature, but I'm too lazy to compile it myself, clang doesn't work on it yet).
- add `ssize` function http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1227r0.html
**  papers to read
- [[http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3465.pdf][Adding heterogeneous comparison lookup toassociative containers]]
* Conversion
- ~typename~ or ~class~? use ~class~ for sfinae(template parameter) and nest
  template, otherwise use ~typename~
- Faiz::index for all container indexes/subscripts/sizes, IOW, Don't use unsigned for subscripts, prefer gsl::index
- prefer ~and/or~ to ~&&/||~, preserve ~&&~ for rvalue reference.
- Geneally, I prefer metafunction over free constexpr function, because the
  formmer can do more.
- Prefer ~enable_if~ in function's template parameter variable.

* Acknowledgements
I can't finish a project without stealing code around, so here are the main sources of the code that can be found in this projects when I didn't write it by myself:
- A great deal of code originally comes from the libcxx/libstdcxx/cppreference implementation of
  type_traits(rewrite many of them with void_t/detectiom idiom)
- many macros in faiz_fwd.hpp is mainly from [[https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3][range-v3]] and [[https://github.com/FrankHB/YSLib][yslib]]
- operators.hpp comes from [[https://github.com/taocpp/operators][tao-operators]], but rerwite some of codes with cpp17,
  and remove support for return rvalue reference.
- compressed_pair.hpp is adapted from https://github.com/Morwenn/tight_pair/
- The tests in tests were preliminary tests adapted from libcxx/libstdcxx/tight_pair/tao-operators/range-v3/boost
* used c++2a features
- std::endian
